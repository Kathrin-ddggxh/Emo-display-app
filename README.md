Inspired by Emoji App from Scrimba's front-end developer career path (module 3).

This project is an attempt to code it without instructions from scratch and also personalise the design.

Idea for future modification:

Change emoji display to photo display (using input type="file"), where users can create a type of collage, representing their mood or personality.
